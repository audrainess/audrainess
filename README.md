Hi, I am @audrainess.

I am a physician-scientist in medical genetics at Baylor College of Medicine.

My work at MD Anderson Cancer Center focuses on somatic and mitochondrial genomics, emerging sequencing technologies (especially single-cell and long-read platforms), and the development of tools for clinical variant interpretation and data integration.

You can reach me at audrainess@gmail.com or on X at @audrainess.
